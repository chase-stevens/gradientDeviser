# Gradient Creator

Gradient creator is a web app that allows you to easily make beautiful gradients and implement them into your website.

## Instructions

You can create your own gradient using the form. Choose two colors and the angle that you'd like the gradient to take.

Alternatively, you can work from a set of preset gradients offered on the left side of the screen. Load one up and use it as a starting point.

Once you're happy with your gradient, you can copy the CSS using the button next to the code. Paste the code into the object you'd like to implement the gradient on, and you're all set!
